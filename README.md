## What is Spark Machine Learning ?
Apache Spark’s machine learning library makes practical machine learning scalable and easy. The library consists of common machine learning algorithms and utilities, including classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, lower-level optimization primitives, and higher-level pipeline APIs.

## What is this Notebook about?

- In this magellan notebook, you will use Apache Spark and the Spark machine learning library to build a Customer Churn Prediction model.
- Customer Churn refers to when a customer ceases to complete target actions (e.g. add to cart, leave a comment, etc.) within a given period of time OR when a customer ceases his or her relationship with a company.

## What kind of data are we working with?
